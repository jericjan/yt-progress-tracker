# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I also used `pnpm` so it's best you use that as well if you want to build or fork this yourself.

## Available Scripts

This was made in Windows so you're gonna have to edit `package.json` a bit to make it work for other OSes.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Make sure to set `TEST_MODE` to `true` before running. It will give the app pre-made stuff that is supposed to be read from `chrome.storage`. There is limited functionality here unfortunately. Best used for when making changes to the UI.


### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
